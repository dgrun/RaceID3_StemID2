StemID2 and RaceID3 algorithms

RaceID3 is an advanced version of RaceID, an algorithm for the identification of rare and abundant cell types from single cell transcriptome data. The method is based on transcript counts obtained with unique molecular identifies.

StemID2 is an algorithm for the derivation of cell lineage trees based on RaceID3 results and predicts multipotent cell identites.

RaceID3 and StemID2 are written in the R computing language.
